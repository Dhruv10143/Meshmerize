<div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dc7cojpvn/image/upload/v1732861776/line_follower_bot_ctjmlw.jpg" alt="#"></img></div>
This project implements a line follower robot that uses a PID control system for smooth and accurate line following. Additionally, it incorporates a shortest path finding algorithm to navigate efficiently through complex paths.

## Features

- **PID Control System:** Utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system to maintain precise control over the robot's movements along the line.

- **Shortest Path Finding:** Implements a shortest path finding algorithm to navigate through complex paths, ensuring the robot reaches its destination efficiently.

- **Customizable Parameters:** The PID control system and path finding algorithm parameters can be customized to suit different line following scenarios and path complexities.

- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides real-time feedback through sensors, enabling the robot to make immediate adjustments for smooth line following and efficient path finding.

## Components

- **Microcontroller:** Utilizes a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to control the robot's movements based on sensor inputs and algorithm outputs.

- **Sensors:** Uses line detection sensors (e.g., infrared sensors) to detect the line and provide feedback to the PID control system.

- **Motor Drivers:** Interfaces with motor drivers to control the speed and direction of the robot's motors for precise movement.

- **Power Supply:** Requires a power supply (e.g., batteries) to power the microcontroller, sensors, motor drivers, and motors.

## Usage

1. Place the robot on the line to be followed.

2. Power on the robot and observe its movement along the line.

3. Monitor the robot's performance and adjust the PID control system parameters if necessary for smoother line following.

4. Observe the robot's path finding behavior in complex environments and adjust the path finding algorithm parameters for optimal path planning.
